# HR Promotions


## Promotions

The fastest way to earn a promotion is by taking an example of other HRs who got promoted through hard work, maturity, not hinting, activity, professionalism, and proper grammar usage. Additionally, being a role model for lower ranks is highly recommended.

If you purchased your rank (bought points, worked your way up by points, or another way), your chance of getting promoted will be low. It is a rare occasion that rank buyers get promoted. BloxStreet's SHRs suggest not to purchase ranks. Work your way up through hard work and dedication instead.

## Demotions
{: .text-red-300 }

If you see someone getting demoted by an SHR, do not attempt to question us or anyone. Additionally, do not comment on the demotion. This is unprofessionalism and lowers your chances of getting a promotion.
