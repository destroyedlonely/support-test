# Communication in BloxStreet 

## Leaking
{: .text-red-300 }


Leaking will result in consequences and can lead to a permanent ban. If you find someone leaking, report the player in a ticket immediately.
Leaking includes referencing chat names, sending screenshots or information from chats, sharing confidential information, and sharing links to documents that lower ranks cannot access normally in public chats.

## Gossiping
{: .text-red-300 }

*   Gossiping is when someone talks about an individual negatively behind their backs.
*   Gossiping about SHRs or staff members is prohibited.
*   If caught, gossiping will result in an instant termination and unappealable permanent ban. 

## Suicidal Thoughts/Actions
{: .text-red-300 }

* Please refrain from discussing suicide or self-harm in the BloxStreet Discord or in DMs with a community member. Some may find this upsetting or distressing.
* We are mostly teenagers and are not qualified to help with these issues. Please talk to a professional or someone you trust instead.
* You may go on inactivity notice to take a break from BloxStreet.
