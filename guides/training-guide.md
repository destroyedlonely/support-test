This guide is intended for Store Manager+. 

The purpose of this guide is to teach Store Manager+ what to do at training sessions and what to say when teaching Low Ranks. 

* The text in *italic* is meant for you to say in-game. 
  * (Copy and paste in-game).
* The text in **bold** or normal are instructions of what you should do during training. 
  * (**DO NOT** copy and paste in-game).

## Training Information
{: .text-red-300 }

Trainings can only be hosted at the following times:

| Training Times     |

* Hosting at any other time is prohibited (unless you have permission from a Head Moderator+), and will result in the appropriate disciplinary actions.
* To host a training, you must claim a session one day before the day you want to host. You do not need to be in the game until :30. When in-game, make sure to use the GUI to set yourself as the Host. 
    - **If you go into the training game and claim Host powers, and you are _not_ the scheduled host, you will receive consequences.** 
* Trainers will answer any inquiries from LRs once teleportation has been completed.
* Once the host claims using the GUI, all trainers are required to go inside the Training Center and find an available counter. Low Ranks should be seated/standing near the large monitors. 
* Hosts are required to select a trusted HR to announce training at the store.
* Trainers should not rush through the script. Allow your Trainees to have time to read the information you’re providing them.
* The limit is five excess trainers. Do not cause arguments.

## Host Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section outlines what the duties the host has and what they should say. Do not follow this section if you are not the Host/Co-Host.

### Host: Claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

At :30, the Host, the Co-Host, and the rankers should join the Training Center to prepare for the session.

To claim the session, click the message at the top of the screen that says “Click here to host one!”. A GUI will pop up with a button that says “Claim” on it. **Please read the information first on that GUI.** Once you have pressed "Claim," the message that says “No training is being hosted right now. Check back later!” on the screen will be removed, and the session will become active. 

At :40, the Co-Host should do the first shout on the group page. The group shout templates are located in a designated area. 

**_NOTE: AFTER YOU HAVE CLAIMED IN-GAME, YOU CANNOT LEAVE THE SERVER, OR YOU WILL RECEIVE CONSEQUENCES! DO NOT CLAIM IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE HAVING INTERNET RELATED ISSUES, THAT MIGHT MEAN YOU GET DISCONNECTED, ETC._** 


### Host: After claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

As the LRs join the server, be sure to encourage them to find a seat at a table.**

**Host:** *Welcome to all of our staff members joining! Please find a seat at a table and sit down while you wait.*


**Host:** *All LRs should be sitting at any of the available tables. Your trainer will answer any questions that you might have.*

You should keep saying the lines above until the start time. Do not spam them… use them when necessary.
The Host and Co-Host will stand towards the front of the Training Center. LRs are expected to find a seat at a table or stand near a table.

### Host/Co-host: Training Starts
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

At :00, the LRs should quietly stand/sit at any of the available tables, and the MRs/HRs should be at their stations. The Host should use /e :slock to stop more LRs from joining, and the Co-Host should post the second group shout. The group shout templates are located in a designated area.

**Host:** *Greetings, everyone! Welcome to today’s training session! My name is (username), and I am your host.*

**Co-Host:** *Hello, everyone! My name is (username), and I am your co-host for today’s training session. I wish you the best of luck.*

**Co-Host:** *Before we commence, I ask everyone to remain silent at all times. You will be watching a presentation before being trained.*

**Host:** *The presentation lasts a few minutes, and we request that you give it your full attention. This presentation teaches you vital information for your success.*

**Co-Host:** *Please note that speaking or distracting others is prohibited during this time, and you will be removed from the server if caught doing so.* 

The host and co-host will stand and monitor the Trainees and the presentation to ensure everything runs smoothly.

To begin the presentation, the Host must press the “Host Settings” button at the bottom left corner of their screen, and then press the button that says ‘Begin’. **If the “Host Settings” button is not appearing on the bottom left corner, the Host should rejoin immediately. The slideshow can only be played once. Be sure to inform the LRs that they can click on the monitors to get a better view.**

### Host/co-host: After Presentation
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

Once the presentation concludes, LRs are required to remain silent for the host’s instructions.

**Host:** *Thank you for paying attention during the presentation. You will now receive further instructions about this training.*

**TRAINERS WILL CONTINUE SITTING AT A TABLE OR STANDING NEAR ONE AFTER THE PRESENTATION HAS ENDED.**

**Co-Host:** *LRs, please stand and form a line facing me. Your order in the line does not matter. You will be teleported when a trainer is available.*

**Host:** *On behalf of all MRs and HRs here, I wish you the best of luck in passing this training session. Trainers, please be patient until your LRs are teleported to you.*

**At this point, the Host will teleport LRs to trainers. Try to keep an eye on where the LRs are to ensure you don’t teleport someone currently being trained.**

**Anybody who decides to idle during training should be kicked._**

**_The LRs are to start at the CAFE section of the training room, then groups may move onto the registers._** 

## Trainer Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section will outline each of the tests the trainers are expected to perform.

### Grammar/Greeting Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

For the Grammar/Greeting Test, as a trainer, you must explain how this test works. Have your group of LRs show their greetings to you. **IMPORTANT: Do not fail LRs for minor grammatical errors. If you can understand their greetings easily, you should pass them.** You are always welcome to give out tips if needed. Make sure to give them a tip on copying and pasting their greeting every time, as it makes things much quicker on their behalf. If they pass, continue to the next test.  If they fail, kick them from the server and explain why.

### Cafe Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The next part of training is the Cafe Test. In this test, you will ask your LRs for any available drink. Wait for them to make it and say “Of course," or something related to that. LRs must have understandable grammar in this test. Ensure that LRs know about the slush machine and the fact it has different flavors that can be selected once a COLD CUP is touched.

### Register Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The final part of training is the Register Test. Please go through a roleplay of your LRs checking you out (including their greetings). If they don’t know how to send a payment request, explain the process to them! Make sure they use understandable grammar and effort. If they fail, explain why when kicking them from the server.

### Passing Trainees
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

If your LRs pass, you must use the :ff command on them, and take them to the green line in the training room. The Host/Co-Host will rank them accordingly and then kick them from the game.

### Training process
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

This section will provide the script for trainers to use. Please try to stick to this layout. You may add emojis. 

**Trainer:** *Hello, everyone! Thank you for attending this training session. My name is (username), and I will be your trainer for today.*

**Trainer:** *During this training, I will be teaching you the basics that every Low Rank should know. I will also be providing important information for your success.*

**Trainer:** *If you need to go AFK for a reason, please make sure to notify me. Failure to do so will result in a removal from the server.*

**Trainer:** *Does anyone have any questions? A response from every Trainee is mandatory.*

At this point, you must wait for the Trainee to respond. If they reply with a positive answer, implying that they are ready to proceed, move on. If not, answer any questions they may have until they are ready to begin. 

### Grammar / Greeting Test Script
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

At this point, you must conduct the Grammar/Greeting Test. Read Section **Grammar/Greeting Test** above to learn how to perform it. 

**Trainer:** *We will start this training with the Grammar/Greeting Test.*

**Trainer:** *When a guest approaches your register at the store, you must greet them with a greeting.*

**Trainer:** *Here is an example of a greeting: “Hello! Welcome to BloxStreet Shopping Center! My name is (username), how may I assist you today?”*

**Trainer:** *You are welcome to add adjectives or emojis to your greeting. Feel free to customize it however you want.*

**Trainer:** *I would now like everyone to state their greeting. Failure to do so will result in a removal from the server.*

**Wait for your LRs to speak.** 

**_If you can understand their greetings, pass them. Do not be strict. If they lack understandable grammar, you must kick the LR from the game, saying they failed._**

### Cafe Test Script
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

**Trainer:** *Congratulations, you have all passed the Greeting Test! We will now move on to the Cafe Test.*

**Trainer:** *In this test, treat me as a guest who has approached your cafe register. Make sure to say your greeting when I approach you.*

**Trainer:** *You must utilize understandable grammar in this test. I will determine if your grammar is understandable or not.*

**Trainer:** *Before we begin, I will show you how to make a coffee. Please pay attention, and avoid going AFK, as the information is for your success.*

**Trainer:** *Firstly, click on the mug. When you have the mug, put in the type of coffee the guest told you to make. I’ll show you an example, please watch closely.*

**At this point, you will show them how to make a simple coffee... by placing the mug on the dispenser.**

**Trainer:** *We also have a slush machine at BloxStreet that allows our guests to choose from a variety of different flavored slushies.*

**Trainer:** *This machine requires a COLD CUP.*

**Trainer:** *To dispense a slush, simply place the COLD CUP up to the slush dispenser of your choice.*

**Trainer:** *If you want to use the handto system, click the H key if you are on a PC.*

**Trainer:** *If you are on mobile, click the button on the left side of your screen to begin the process.*

**Trainer:** *Now that you’ve seen how to make drinks, it’s time for you to have a turn. Remember to use your greeting. If you need assistance in this test, you are welcome to ask me.*

**Trainer:** *We will now begin this test. Please state your greetings.*

**Wait for all LRs to state their greetings before stating the order.**

**Trainer:**  *Hi! Could I get a Regular Coffee and a Cherry Slush?*

**Wait for a response and the order.**

**_If they pass, proceed. If they fail, tell them why they’ve failed and kick them. Be sure to remind them that they can always attend the next session!_**

### Register Test Script
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

**Trainer:** *Congratulations, you have all passed the Cafe Test. We will now begin the Register Test.*

**AT THIS POINT, PLEASE MOVE TO THE REGISTERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAINING ROOM.**

**Trainer:** *When a guest approaches your register at the store, you should greet them with a polite greeting.*

**Trainer:** *When they ask to be checked out, click “Open Sale” on the register.*

**Trainer:** *Type in their username, then click “Finalize Sale.”*

**Trainer:** *Click "Robux Payment" or "Card Payment," depending on the guest's preference.*

**Trainer:** *Remind the customer to scan their BloxStreet Cash Card on the payment screen, and after doing so, inform the guest to enjoy the rest of their day.*

**Trainer:** *Is everyone here ready to begin the test? A response from every LR is mandatory.*

**_THE REGISTERS IN THE TRAINING CENTER WORK!_** 
{: .text-red-100 }
If they say yes, begin.  If they say no, answer any questions until they are ready.*


**Note: This part is the in-test script.**

**Wait for their greeting.** *Hi, may I please check out my items?*

**Wait for them to say.** *Thank you!*

**_If they pass, proceed. If they fail, tell them why they failed and kick them. Be sure to remind them that they can always attend the next session!_**

**Trainer:** *Congratulations, you have all passed the Register Test! You have each completed all tests, meaning we can now conclude this training.*

**Trainer:** *If you are currently a Senior Team Member, you will be promoted to Store Intern. Store Interns are required to attend shifts to rank up. Shifts are hosted at the store daily.*

**Trainer:** *Please follow me to the ranking lines so you can be ranked. Congratulations on passing!*

**Trainer:** *Stay online until the ranker dismisses you, saying that you have been ranked. It has been a pleasure training you.*

**:ff them and take them to the ranking line.**

## Training Conclusion
{: .text-red-300 }
Once the training has ended, there should be no LRs left in the server and very few MRs or HRs. All trainers **should’ve left the server** after they’ve finished training. If there are people left, encourage them to leave to go to the store. **Absolutely nothing else should be happening after training sessions. Do not sit around giving feedback as it is unnecessary. Have an SHR do :place all if there are a lot of people still in the server or just shutdown.**


Leave the game when finished training or once you have been ranked. Do not do anything else.


At the end of training, the Co-Host should post the last group shout. The group shout templates are located in a designated area. 


**_If a Junior Moderator+ chooses to take a photo at the conclusion of the session, follow their directions._**
