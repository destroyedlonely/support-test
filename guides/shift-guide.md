## Joining & Leaving during a Shift
{: .text-red-300 }
- Before claiming a shift, make sure you have a good internet connection and can remain at the store for at least 35 minutes.
- Each shift lasts for 30 minutes. If you know you cannot stay for the entire shift, do not claim it.
- If you lose connection or disconnect, the shift will be announced as concluded within #session-notice. However, the shift can continue once you rejoin.
- **Do not reclaim the shift if you disconnect.** Reclaiming will send another announcement and restart the shift timer.
- If you reclaim a shift, there may be consequences for the disruption it can cause.
