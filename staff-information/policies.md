## Points Policy
{:.text-red-300}
Thank you for purchasing points at BloxStreet - your donation is appreciated. As a thank you from us, you receive a rank, depending on the amount of points you used. 

**Please note the following:**
{:.text-red-000}
* Lying about rank purchases through points will result in a **staff blacklist.** 
* Abusing will result in consequences. 
* You still need to follow all of our rules. If you don't, you'll be subject to the same moderation action as everyone else, including demotions, blacklists, and permanent bans.
* Purchasing **Store Executive** will significantly decrease your chances to be promoted to Junior Moderator. Everyone promoted to this role is background checked, so we will know if you bought the rank.

## Reclaiming Policy
{:.text-red-300}
If you have been **demoted** or **blacklisted** for any reason, reclaiming a rank immediately after facing consequences will lead to a **permanent ban.** If you would like to appeal a staff blacklist, you may read more [here](https://support.bloxstreet.store/appeals/pbanandblacklist.html).

## Strike Policy
{:.text-red-300}
**Please note the following:**
{:.text-red-000}
* Only **Junior Moderator+** can hand out strikes. 
* Strikes are **permanent.** Once assigned, they cannot be removed.
* Receiving **three** strikes is a demotion. 
* If you get demoted, you are free to work your way back up! 

## Resignation Policy
{:.text-red-300}
Resignations are **FINAL**. No reranks will be offered if you change your mind. Please think over resignations carefully. They are a big thing and you need to be certain. You **WON'T** be ranked back after you resign. Reranks are also not given to users who are demoted. 


## Rank Transfer Policy 
{:.text-red-300}
As a staff member, you're allowed to transfer your rank onto another account. If you wish to do so, create a ticket in the BloxStreet communications server. 

You cannot transfer your rank onto another account if you are hacked or banned by Roblox. 

## Hacked Policy 
{:.text-red-300}
BloxStreet does not offer rank transfers if your account has been hacked. We expect you to keep your account safe and secure. Your account is **100%** your responsibility.

If you're an MR or HR and your account is hacked, you **must** inform an SHR immediately.
