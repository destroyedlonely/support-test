3.  Abusing admin, the staff panel, or any permissions will result in consequences. Refer to the [Punishment Guide](https://support.bloxstreet.store/guides/punishment-guide.html) for details. 
4.  Professionalism is required while in public eye. Assistant Supervisor+ should utilize proper grammar in all BloxStreet games. Behaving unprofessionally reflects badly on our group. We don't want to be known as a group that behaves unprofessionally.
5.  Please remember to **work** while at the store. Messing around looks bad, and also leads to an increase in unsatisfied guests. Staff members who mess around at the store will not be promoted.
6.  For hosting shifts and trainings:
  *  **Store Director+ can host training sessions**
  *  **Store Manager+ can train at training sessions**
  *  **Assistant Director+ can host shifts**
  *  **Store Director+ can supervise the store**
7.  Please respect all decisions made by SHRs.
8.  Do not instigate drama. If you have an issue with a fellow staff member, please report it to a Junior Moderator+. Keep all personal drama **OUT** of the staff team.
9.  Do not make unnecessary announcements with the announcement feature on the staff panel.
10.  Don't intervene with Junior Moderator+ moderation. We know what we're doing, and minimods are not needed nor appreciated.
11.  Hinting for a promotion for yourself or another staff member is prohibited.
12.  Simping for Junior Moderator+ will not be tolerated. Please don't suck up to Junior Moderator+ staff for promotions.
13.  Don't try to find ways to avoid these rules. Use common sense at all times.
