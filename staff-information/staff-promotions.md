## Trainee Team Member-Senior Team Member
{:.text-red-300}
In order to receive a promotion as a Trainee Team Member, Junior Team Member, or Senior Team Member, you must attend and pass a training session. Attending and passing one training session will rank you up once.

## Store Intern-Assistant Manager
{:.text-red-300}
In order to receive a promotion as a **Store Intern, Assistant Supervisor, Floor Supervisor, or Assistant Manager**, you should attend and be noticed at a shift. Utilizing proper grammar, behaving professionally, and showing dedication will increase your chances of a promotion. Attending a shift does not guarantee a promotion.

## Store Manager-Store Executive
{:.text-red-300}
There are multiple factors the administration team looks at when promoting a Store Manager to Assistant Director. The same applies when we do HR promotions.

If you are a Store Manager+, you should remain active on all BloxStreet games and its communications server, utilize proper grammar, behave professionally, and show dedication in order to have a chance of a promotion. Junior Moderator+ can promote Store Managers at random times every day. These promotions are more difficult than Store Intern - Assistant Manager ones and often require time and effort.

### **Store Manager Promotion Guide:**
{:.text-blue-000}
{: .no_toc }

> 1.   Store Managers must utilize proper grammar in all BloxStreet games.
> 2.   Store Managers must possess a certain number of characteristics (professionalism, maturity, respect, etc.) 
> 3.   Having past moderation history (warnings, kicks, server bans, blacklists, etc.) significantly decreases your chance of a promotion.  
> 4.   Store Managers should be in the communications server. Talking in channels and attending events does help! 
> 5.   Store Managers should frequently work at the store and attend training sessions. It is highly recommended to spend more than 120 minutes at the store each week and attend  a reasonable number of training sessions. Be sure to WORK when youâ€™re at the store. Going off-duty or supervising will not increase your chances of a promotion. 
> 6.   Please do NOT suck up to SHRs for a promotion. Store Managers may be blacklisted from obtaining Assistant Director if caught simping. 
> 7.   Hinting for a promotion will not benefit you in any way. 
> 8.   If you encounter a disruptive customer, deal with them calmly and professionally. Follow the procedures for handling a disruptive customer. 
> 9.   Greetings should be unique. We recommend copying and pasting, adding emojis, and using moderate vocabulary. 
> 10.  It is recommended to have current or past experience as an MR+ at a well-known group (i.e. Pastriez, SizzleBurger, Koala Cafe). However, current or past experience is not  required. 

> Keep in mind that these are only some requirements Store Managers must meet.
